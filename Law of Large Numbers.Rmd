Testing the Law of Large Numbers with a Normal Distribution (or any distribution with a finite mean)

```{r}

n<-c(1:10000)
y<-abs(rnorm(10000))
s<-cumsum(y)
plot(s/n,xlab="n",
ylim=c(0,1),type="l")

```



Testing the Law of Large Numbers with a Cauchy distribution 

```{r}
n<-c(1:10000)
y<-abs(rcauchy(10000))
s<-cumsum(y)
plot(s/n,xlab="n",
ylim=c(0,20),type="l")

```
